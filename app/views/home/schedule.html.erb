      <p class='description'>
Javascript is rapidly becoming a THE first class citizen when developing mobile web apps. Whether your building on a Node.js stack, using one of the flavor of the month MV* frameworks, or just using vanilla js; testing your javasript is more important than ever. This talk will focus on using the Jasmine testing framework and how to drive the design of your application using all it's BDD awesomeness.

      <p class='description'>
        Geared towards the Indie developer, this talk deals with what you do after you release your app. Your app is 'born' when you ship. You have to nurture it to give it a chance to succeed. In development you only had to worry about your code. Now you have to take care of all of your customers and their needs without sacrificing the vision and focus of your app. We'll see how to use tools like analytics and social media as well as how to align your goals with your users' expectations.

      <p class='description'>
      With the release of Windows 8 on the Microsoft Surface tablet and new phones from companies like HTC and Nokia, this operating system has started to gain notice and market share. That is great news for developers as this technology stack enables us to build out awesome applications. Adam will present an overview of this platform from a developer’s perspective. They will cover the creation of a RTM based windows store application using Visual Studio 2012 and XAML/C# as they walk us through this application which manages a Jenkins continuous integration server with a windows mobile application.

      Learn about some of the tools that make it easier to create a responsive website/web application: frameworks, navigation patterns, CSS preprocessors such as Sass/LESS, and polyfills. Responsive design is easier than it seems: the secret is taking advantage of resources such as these instead of trying to solve every problem yourself.

      <p class='description'>
      Networking is an essential part of any mobile application. Unfortunately, it's also one of the hardest to get right. In order to provide a great user experience, an app must be able to synchronize between client and server seamlessly, handling slow connections and unpredictable system events gracefully.
      </p>
      <p class='description'>
AFIncrementalStore presents an order-of-magnitude improvement in developing robust client-server apps on iOS. In combination with the Heroku Core Data Buildpack, it's now possible to build out a fully-functioning app in a matter of minutes. Come learn how AFIncrementalStore and the Heroku Core Data Buildpack work; in doing so, you'll get a deep dive into Core Data itself, and learn about the next big thing in iOS development.

      <h2>Well-Designed Travel</h2>
      <p class='description'>
About a year ago, [the speaker and their spouse] applied the principles of mobile UX design to our lives by becoming digital nomads. Since we both work in technology and can work from home, why can’t home be wherever we want it to be? Just as a good mobile app streamlines an existing site into its basic components to free itself from the desktop, we trimmed down our belongings to the most essential items so that we can be truly mobile. 
      </p>
      <p class='description'>
We got rid of our apartment, and most everything in it to travel slowly around the world all while working full-time as developers. This new lifestyle (though not without its challenges), has enabled us to visit new places, learn new languages, skip the bitter Chicago winter and spend time with the friends and family that we rarely got to see in our former 9-5 lives. We’ve visited 6 countries and lived in 8 states over the past year. As we embark on Chapter 2 of this adventure, I hope to share what we’ve learned and how our next year will be even more efficient than the last.

      <p class='description'>
        The browser on your device is growing up! With new HTML5 APIs we are able to access your device's hardware and start writing apps that rival native big boys. HTML5 APIs include access the the device's camera, microphone, GPS, compass file system and accelerometer.

This talk will take a look at what we can start integrating into our apps today as well as what we can look forward to in future releases of mobile browsers. Be sure to make it out to this as as it will be packed with fantastic live examples including a mobile based motion detection security camera and a CSS3 speedometer!

      <p class='description'>
      Figuring out how to do BDD for iOS isn't exactly clear cut. There are a number of contenders for framework of choice for both the integration and unit layers. Even when you've figured out which framework, it's not always easy to figure out what parts of your application to test and why. You're in luck! I've spent the last 1.5 years doing all the hard work for you! I'll offer a comparison of the popular BDD frameworks so you can figure out what will work best for you. I'll also be going over how to effectively BDD iOS applications as well as looking at how to retrofit your application with tests to cover the application's high value paths.

      <p class='description'>
      RubyMotion enables developers to write native iOS apps using the Ruby language. Developers can amplify the power of RubyMotion by using of some of the available libraries, packaged as Gems and Pods. This talk will demonstrate some of the more popular libraries, while highlighting some of the "gotchas".

The first eight minutes will introduce RubyMotion for those who are unfamiliar with it. The remainder of the talk will feature demos of the libraries in action, live coding, and a generous helping of TDD. To get the most out of the talk, the audience member should have some experience programming iOS, Ruby, or both.

      <p class='description'>
        Based on the opening keynote Miko gave at the Mobile Developer Summit 2012 in front of 2000 developers in Bangalore, Miko explains how to drive key metrics in your mobile apps using contemporary research on the human brain and behavior. Engagement, retention, and conversion can all be understood through insights from the cutting edge of brain research. The panoply of engagement metrics including session length, time between sessions, actions per session are all driven by neuroscientific mechanisms including habit design, addiction, reward, motivation and emotional behavior. Gamification rules such as collection and completion behavior are understood by motivational systems in the midbrain. In app time scales that accomodate nerve and synaptic conduction times help us understand user requirements for speed and responsiveness in application user experience and help us understand "what fires together, wires together". Conversion can also be understood from a neuroscientific perspective, by observing how this measurement can be improved by understanding the limbic system and how decisions involve both fore and midbrain structures. Finally retention of users, a key facet of overall growth can be understood through mechanisms such as brand affiliation and preference, the use and effect of notification systems and how it interacts with threat processing and how associative memory is stored in the hippocampus for recall by the "emotional brain". Attendees will come away with concrete examples of effective techniques, a strong understanding of key metrics that drive success in the mobile app business as well as a strong framework for analyzing mobile application design and development.

      No doubt about it: mobile is an exciting, rapidly evolving technology. There's a lot of talk about what features will be supported next, what new technologies will emerge. But in the midst of our obsession with the latest and greatest, mobile is changing lives around the world. It's providing connectivity to people who wouldn't have it otherwise, and empowering everyone from your next door neighbor to farmers in Kenya. Only by looking at how people around the world are using mobile technology can we really understand just how important mobile really is, and the potential it has.
